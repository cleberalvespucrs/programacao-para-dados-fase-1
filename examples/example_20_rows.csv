So while it is still recommended that you play the original first, it is not strictly required. Sable's Grimoire is a visual novel series set in a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. It follows the adventures of Sable, a young human who wants to become a magic researcher, during his time at Amadronia Academy. Sable spends his everyday life at Amadronia surrounded by demi-humans, including elves, pixies, and succubi, as he learns more about this magical world and the creatures within it. With Sable's first year at Amadronia coming to an end, he wants nothing more than to spend the upcoming break at the academy, studying in peace while his friends and classmates head home for the holidays. However, his half-dragon best friend and roommate, Drakan, has other plans in store for him. She has been trying to get him to visit her home for months now, and with a sizeable break right before around the corner, that time has finally come. Before the duo can set off, a surprise visit from Drakan's mother, Nidhogg, gives them reason to pause. Holding an ominous necklace in her hand, she forces the seemingly cursed artifact onto Sable, then sets him up with one trial after another. Dragged to either extreme by these two frightfully powerful beings, will Sable manage to survive the holidays in one piece?

Uncover a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the wolves of the nearby lands. Streamlined Combat: Gone are the days of combo memorization and button mashing. Lugaru uses a context-sensitive combat system to put all the moves at your finger tips. It’s up to you to choose the right move at the right time and think your way through the fights. Open-Ended Strategy: Each level presents you with an environment and a series of enemies. How you choose to defeat your adversaries is entirely up to you. Storm in from the front and fight everyone at once or ambush your foes one at a time with stealth attacks. Ragdoll Physics: Not only does striking your enemies do damage, but so does colliding with the environment once you’ve knocked them off their feet. Nothing does more damage than a swift rabbit kick that sends the enemy hurtling into a stone wall. Environmental Detail: Factors like wind direction and whether or not you remembered to clean the blood off your knife affect your ability to sneak up on the enemy undetected. Brutal AI: Enemies in Lugaru prefer unfair fights. Expect them to shout for back up, attack in groups, and exploit any superior weaponry they can find. Moddability: Turning on Lugaru’s debug mode gives you access to the map editor so you can build your own levels, campaigns and mods. Debug mode also enables crazy cheats that allow players to fly, have infinite health, explode enemies’ heads and set themselves on fire further igniting anyone who comes too close. New HD Textures: The original Lugaru has gotten a more modern, graphical makeover while still staying true to the game’s spirit. Special thanks to Tim Soret for his HD texture pack.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/header.jpg?t=1586267846","http://www.wolfire.com/","","",True,True,True,0,"",0,380,100,"",0,257,"",74,0,74,0,"Wolfire Games","Wolfire Games","Single-player","Action","Action,3D Fighter,Indie,Martial Arts,Parkour,Beat 'em up,Singleplayer,Fighting,Difficult,Adventure,Open World,Atmospheric,RPG,Sandbox,Swordplay,3D,Third Person,6DOF","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_c4d0d9e50c91331d9f2f58b2004a7457345d0492.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_5d7acc125d781e7a2b8e2422179098e5e44da340.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_8f7930cdde959a1e6a4bf8b86ee6c2ba4ea1f38d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_3803004fbda8c316568f9b95c2c2aa89860a9c8c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_ea0ac8f320bbc1cd1aa6c7968a1774900c8407dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_c7cd14e468517bfec89f0bce1ca55d938170eed7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_8904af693d9e46050b12032d0f5dac0b0ff6fbf0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_2cc1907b986766ad59706211f38884be203baef4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_ff2f9a0553ab77061211903782f9301ee9f09909.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_16ca10f8a841a98d8ad6972c0f27b915fce3eb76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_d85a29c9c01cde2173a129b4b5f795e996a81c00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_153174a147791337833d51aa6dbf2b5640316571.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_32091ffaf8819b7d8c79f0c09eb5c5ce6dccc3dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_095a6c380077c8a38dd8077926c558cd4fb67912.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/25010/ss_ab01243f1fd378257a6eb0523ac0303e82a84e91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586267846",""

1425330,"Eye of the Beholder","Nov 30, 2020","0 - 20000",0,0,0.0,0,"Step into war-torn enemy territory in this immersive VR game experience based on the Oscar-shortlisted documentary MY ENEMY, MY BROTHER (2015). EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is a 20 beta minute experience that subverts the war-game genre as players must choose to combat or collaborate with others. As a documentarian I am inspired by real life situations and stories and in 2014, I was lucky enough to meet two men whose story changed my life and that of many others. Zahed and Najah are former enemy soldiers who have become blood brothers for life. Zahed was an Iranian child soldier during the Iran-Iraq War when he found Najah, an enemy soldier, injured in a bunker. Zahed made a split-second decision in the heat of the battlefield and instead of shooting Najah, he risked his own life to save him. I was deeply inspired by Zahed's ability to recognize the humanity in his enemy. His act of bravery has had lasting ramifications in both their lives and those of their families. I documented their story in a film, MY ENEMY, MY BROTHER, which resonated strongly with audiences across the world. It landed on the Oscar shortlist, was nominated for an Emmy award, and premiered as a NYTimes OpDoc in 2015. The film evolved into a feature documentary, which premiered at Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival in 2017. The strong international response to the films, as well as feedback in the Q and A sessions, led us to explore the film’s core themes further. We wanted to bring the remarkable empathy that Najah and Zahed felt for one another into a unique space, where audiences would be able to step into their shoes and make choices for themselves, that could make them rethink their decisions in real life. We developed what is now the EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR immersive experience. The EYE OF THE BEHOLDER VR subverts the war-game genre to explore how we judge one another as friend or foe. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is set in a conflict zone, but in essence each decision reflects the kind of snap judgement made in school yards, street corners and board rooms across the globe. Do I trust this person? Are they friendly or a threat? Should I collaborate with this person or fight them? As the player faces each challenge in the bunker and decides whether or not to collaborate with the other soldiers, their decisions affect how the other soldier responds to them, and ultimately determines who makes it out alive. As the player discovers in the end, their decisions also impact the welfare of nearby communities.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/header.jpg?t=1607025308","","","mandy@fathomfilm.ca",True,False,False,0,"",0,6,2,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Reptoid Games","Fathom Film Group","Single-player","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Casual,Documentary,Cinematic,Singleplayer,Experimental,VR,First-Person,Education,Multiple Endings,Adventure,Indie,Choices Matter,Visual Novel,Choose Your Own Adventure,Character Action Game","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_74fef06971b6a0cc2a5dcd0c548f12265efe65f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_a8a0a735e101e8743f21ec1a090df8de02293a42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_7307be5ac5ae3118aafbae07094fd1b02859d0ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_6bfe747e20087584479b4bdc7d861b032be217dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_72a74febf38ac6b330698a3099299f5ffd7e8bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1425330/ss_0363899a532ba5cd51671e9fec31d0b6bcc674dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607025308","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256801367/movie_max.mp4?t=1604429568"
